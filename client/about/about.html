                <p>We simply are three students that we saw an oportunity to provide people with a good and practical solution to a very prominent, but overlooked problem. We now about this problem mainly because we have lived it, and wish that there's a better alternative to paying a parking ticket</p>
                <h1><small>Our approach to the problem</small></h1>
                <p>Like any important project we planned out throughly the development of our solution.It was a process that took time and dedication, and through the whole process we kept achieving a more tangable product. We first design our persona. The person that our project was aimed to.</p>
                <H2>Persona</H2>
                <p>We focused users that drive, have a credit card account, have a smart phone with available internet access, and frequent malls. This take people that are between 20 to 35 years old. Our idea is just to create a better alternative to paying a parking ticket, since it can be quite inconviniet sometimes.

                <p>We interviewed some people about this problem. Check it out!</p>

                <H2>Design</H2>
                <p>After researching about what kind of "feel" a color give, we opted to go with varients of green and black. It looks absolutly cool doesn't it? Of course, we didn't only think in the colors, but we also thought about the design in general. You can check the whole plan <a href="http://juanca17.github.io/PaletaColores/">right here.</a></p><br>
                <H2>Feedback</H2>
                <p>A truly great project never reaches a finished state. It can do what one wants but it needs to keep changing, evolving. This can be achieved by simple feedback, and applying it too of course. We went ahead and ask some of our classmates what they thought about our product, and here's what they said.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                        <h2><small>Team of Marco, Miguel, and Samuel</small></h2>
                        <p>Feedback: Improve de design of the headers, check that the images are implemente correctly into the code, more text, and overall a better design.<br>
                        We took this feedback mainly because they aren't complicated aspects, and we can manage working with them to make a better user experience</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3" >
                        <h2><small>Team of Constanza, and Victor</small></h2>
                        <p>Feedback: To show the concept design of how the application will look when developed, and to add the option to resize images for a better navigation<br>
                        We took this feedback because it's important to setup and to create protypes of the product early on and also to create a more user friendly navigation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3">
                        <h2><small>Team of Juan Antonio, and Raul Flores</small></h2>
                        <p>Feedback: More mockups, and to make sure there's no kind o data lag when paying<br>
                        We considered this because, although is really good feedback that can lead to a better working application, we would have to start degotiation with companies, which can be quite complicated.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-sm-3" >
                        <h2><small>Team of Pablo, and Salvador</small></h2>
                        <p>Feedback: No use of a chip. Find a better way to make the payment.<br>
                        We didn't take this because we cannot scrap the idea of a physical paying method, since some people may not be able to pay in a digital way.</p>
